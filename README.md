# RenderEngine
Usage:
- The engine was created in Visual Studio for 64-bit Windows
- Shader path:
  - The engine requires the path for the shader files, I didn't have the time to implement a good way for file paths, so it has to be set manually set in order to load the shaders.
  - This can be found in Render.cpp >> line 139 and line 142
