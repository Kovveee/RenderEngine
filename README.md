# RenderEngine
Usage:
- The engine was created in Visual Studio for 64-bit Windows
-Shader path:
  - The engine requires the path for the shader files, I was not able to implement a good way for referencing the file path yet, so it has to be set manually set in order to load the shaders.
  - This can be found in Render.cpp >> line 139 and line 142
